# NOTE

All credit goes to Zura. I made this repo to help follow along with him on youtube and named each branch after the video it corresponds eg.. part-1 = branch-1.

You can find the playlist [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLQuc_7jk__Uk_QnJMPndbdKECcTEwTA1). I learn off of YouTube a lot, and sometimes it can be difficult to learn when you get stuck in the middle of a long video and only have the final source code to look at.

## Please give Zura a like and subscribe on his Youtube and Social Channels.

It's the least we can do for him putting out amazing free content!.
